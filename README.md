## Sorting Algorithm Visualizer
This project is a sorting algorithm visualization app. Sorting alogrithms and their time complexities, efficiency, and use cases have always been interesting to me. 
I also really enjoy the patterns that emerge when they are visualized. I built this app to both learn React native and create a sorting visualizer that I enjoy playing around with and watch as much as I enjoyed building. 
App page can be accessed here: https://tasselhat.github.io/SortingAlgorithmReactApp/ (Google Chrome + Desktop recommended but can be used with any browser or device)

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.
